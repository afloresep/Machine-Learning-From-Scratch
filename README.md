## Purpose

The main idea behind this project comes from a post I read a few days ago: 

_"I think every data scientist should at least once spend some time coding the most widely used and fundamental ML models from scratch (regression, decision trees, random forest, boosting, NNâ€™s). You will see a step change in your ability to work and solve problems with models if you do this and you will avoid a ton of pitfalls."_

So that is exactly what we are going to do.
